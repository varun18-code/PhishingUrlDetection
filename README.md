## Phishing URL Detection using Machine Learning
<br>
This project implements a machine learning-based system for detecting phishing URLs. It utilizes various URL features, such as length, domain attributes, and keywords, to train a model that classifies URLs as phishing or legitimate.

<br>
<br>
Features:-
<br>

Machine Learning Model: Trained models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to predict phishing URLs.

Feature Extraction: Extracts relevant features like URL length, domain, and suspicious keywords.

Real-Time Predictions: Integrated into a Flask web application to provide real-time phishing URL predictions.

Continuous Improvement: System allows retraining with new data to adapt to emerging phishing techniques.
<br>

Technologies Used:-

Python

Flask (for API and web application)

Scikit-learn (for machine learning model training)

Pandas (for data processing)

NumPy (for numerical computations)

HTML/CSS (for frontend)

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/phishing-url-detection.git

cd phishing-url-detection


Install the required dependencies:-

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the Flask application:-

bash
python app.py

The web application will be hosted on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Usage
Open the web application in your browser.

Enter a URL in the input field and click "Check".

The system will display whether the URL is phishing or legitimate, along with a confidence score.

Model Training
To train the model with new data:

Prepare a CSV dataset of URLs with labels (phishing/legitimate).

Preprocess the data using feature extraction methods provided in data_preprocessing.py.

Train the model using train_model.py.

Update the model file (model.pkl) for the Flask application.
